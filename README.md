We designed a cooking app to aid people who dislike cookingbooks or aren't a that good of a cook.
Our main focus was to make a really good-looking and handy app that will encourage people to cook more instead of getting freezermeals or takeaway meals.
Healthy eating is important.

This project is been made in 3 projects being: ASP.NET, an ASP API and Xamarin.
