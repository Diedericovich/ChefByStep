Snapper good but its best with fresh striped bass. Be very careful stirring the sauce: the fish should remain intact. The tomatoes should be fresh and cooked al crudo, till the juices are released but they are still a little raw. By adding the fish early on, its flavor infuses the whole sauce, so the tomatoes and fish are no longer separate entities, but fully integrated into the sauce. And the capers and olives reinforce the flavor of the fish with brine;chop tomatoes roughly|dice garlic|deskin fish and cut into bite sized chunks|saute three tablespoons of oil with garlic for two minutes over medium heat|add fish, stirring carefully until browned|once browned, add salt and pepper, then half glass of white wine and turn up heat|stir carefully till wine is nearly evaporated|meantime heat pot of hot water for pasta, generously salted|when wine is nearly evaporated, reduce heat, add tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes|add capers, parsley and olives|when the tomato juice is released and the sauce is just thickening, turn off heat|cook pasta al dente|carefully add the sauce to the pasta over a little heat and stir gently for a minute or two;10;25

Upma is a state of mind. The refrain is simple: Carb of choice, toasted in ghee-bloomed spices, then cooked with assorted vegetables and curry leaves and topped with tomato ketchup. In South India the carb of choice is typically toasted semolina, thickened into a creamy, savory porridge. But it can also be made with bread. Bread upma can be made in two contrasting ways. This version captures the best of both;In a wok set over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and heat until shimmering|Add the cubed bread and raw cashews to the pan and toast in oil until crunchy and golden brown, shaking the pan frequently and tossing the bread so it doesn't burn.

Set aside|Use a serrated knife to trim the domes from the tops of the cakes and slice each in half horizontally to create four layers. Place one layer on a serving platter and brush the top with about 2 tablespoons of the soaker. Stir the lime filling briefly to loosen it. Then use a small offset spatula to spread about one-third of the filling over the cake, getting it right up to the edge.

This recipe replaces the mozarella with brie. A bold but satisfying choice! A fine Brie is just as delicious at room temperature smeared on crusty bread as it is warm, oozing out of flaky pastry. And it's REALLY good folded into a fresh tomatoey, garlicky sauce for pasta. Put aside any residual anti-Brie sentiments and give this one a shot before tomatoes disappear for the year. You won't regret it;Put the Brie in the freezer for about 20 minutes to firm up a little. This will make it easier to cut when the time comes|Roughly chop the tomatoes and put them in a large serving bowl. Finely chop the garlic and add it to the bowl.

It takes a bit of time to reduce the strawberry mixture to a thick, jammy purée, but it's worth it, since it gets used both in the cake and also the frosting to create a beautiful - and delicious - swirl effect. Its best decorated with lemon wedges and/or strawberries but you can never miss with sprinkles;Make the purée: In a small bowl and rub the granulated sugar and lemon zest together. In a medium pot toss the strawberries and lemon juice to combine. Add the sugar and salt tossing everything to combine. Cook over medium heat stirring frequently until the mixture becomes saucy and the strawberries start to break down in 8 to 10 minutes|Use an immersion blender to purée the mixture in the pot.

If desired tint the batter deeper pink with food coloring|Scoop the batter into the prepared pan using an ice cream scoop filling each cavity three-quarters full|Bake the cupcakes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (or with just a few moist crumbs) in 17 to 20 minutes. Cool completely|Make the lemon curd buttercream: Place the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. In a medium saucepan combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir until the mixture begins to bubble but as soon as it begins to boil, stop stirring.

Begin whipping the egg whites on medium speed raising to medium-high speed once the mixture looks frothy. When the sugar mixture reaches 240 degrees F remove the pot from the heat and gradually add the hot sugar syrup to the mixer in a slow steady stream. Continue whipping until the meringue has reached full volume and the bowl is no longer warm to the touch for 5 to 6 minutes|With the mixer running on medium speed gradually add the butter a few tablespoons at a time mixing to fully combine before adding more. This will take several minutes and the mixture will look light and fluffy. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix in the lemon curd with a silicone spatula. I use sort of a folding motion to incorporate it, because it helps to deflate the frosting a bit and make it smoother.|Gently fold the strawberry purée into the frosting, drizzling it in about a third at a time and folding it a few times but not incorporating it fully. Use an ice cream scoop to transfer swirled frosting on top of each cupcake and use a small offset spatula to swirl it|Top with a lemon slice and a strawberry half;30;40

Add the stout and stir to incorporate. Cover and simmer over low heat for at least 3-4 hours, until the beans and beef are fully tender.|Add the crushed tortilla chips about an hour before serving, stirring them in so they break down and thicken the chili.

I find that boneless beef short ribs, which are marbled with fat and collagen, do all the heavy lifting in this recipe and help you arrive at a final stew that’s just as glossy, satisfying, and full of deep, savory flavor as the original.;Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Generously season the short ribs with salt and pepper and heat a small (1 1/2 to 3–quart) oven-safe saucepan over medium-high heat.
