Snapper good but its best with fresh striped bass. Be very careful stirring the sauce: the fish should remain intact. The tomatoes should be fresh and cooked al crudo, till the juices are released but they are still a little raw. By adding the fish early on, its flavor infuses the whole sauce, so the tomatoes and fish are no longer separate entities, but fully integrated into the sauce. And the capers and olives reinforce the flavor of the fish with brine;chop tomatoes roughly|dice garlic|deskin fish and cut into bite sized chunks|saute three tablespoons of oil with garlic for two minutes over medium heat|add fish, stirring carefully until browned|once browned, add salt and pepper, then half glass of white wine and turn up heat|stir carefully till wine is nearly evaporated|meantime heat pot of hot water for pasta, generously salted|when wine is nearly evaporated, reduce heat, add tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes|add capers, parsley and olives|when the tomato juice is released and the sauce is just thickening, turn off heat|cook pasta al dente|carefully add the sauce to the pasta over a little heat and stir gently for a minute or two;10;25

Upma is a state of mind. The refrain is simple: Carb of choice, toasted in ghee-bloomed spices, then cooked with assorted vegetables and curry leaves and topped with tomato ketchup. In South India the carb of choice is typically toasted semolina, thickened into a creamy, savory porridge. But it can also be made with bread. Bread upma can be made in two contrasting ways. This version captures the best of both;In a wok set over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and heat until shimmering|Add the cubed bread and raw cashews to the pan and toast in oil until crunchy and golden brown, shaking the pan frequently and tossing the bread so it doesn't burn.

This recipe replaces the mozarella with brie. A bold but satisfying choice! A fine Brie is just as delicious at room temperature smeared on crusty bread as it is warm, oozing out of flaky pastry. And it's REALLY good folded into a fresh tomatoey, garlicky sauce for pasta. Put aside any residual anti-Brie sentiments and give this one a shot before tomatoes disappear for the year. You won't regret it;Put the Brie in the freezer for about 20 minutes to firm up a little.

It takes a bit of time to reduce the strawberry mixture to a thick, jammy purée, but it's worth it, since it gets used both in the cake and also the frosting to create a beautiful - and delicious - swirl effect. Its best decorated with lemon wedges and/or strawberries but you can never miss with sprinkles;Make the purée: In a small bowl and rub the granulated sugar and lemon zest together. In a medium pot toss the strawberries and lemon juice to combine. Add the sugar and salt tossing everything to combine. Cook over medium heat stirring frequently until the mixture becomes saucy and the strawberries start to break down in 8 to 10 minutes|Use an immersion blender to purée the mixture in the pot.

Use an ice cream scoop to transfer swirled frosting on top of each cupcake and use a small offset spatula to swirl it|Top with a lemon slice and a strawberry half;30;40

Add the stout and stir to incorporate. Cover and simmer over low heat for at least 3-4 hours, until the beans and beef are fully tender.|Add the crushed tortilla chips about an hour before serving, stirring them in so they break down and thicken the chili.
