Snapper good but its best with fresh striped bass. Be very careful stirring the sauce: the fish should remain intact. The tomatoes should be fresh and cooked al crudo, till the juices are released but they are still a little raw.

And the capers and olives reinforce the flavor of the fish with brine;Chop tomatoes roughly and dice the garlic. Deskin the fish and cut into bite sized chunks.|Saute three tablespoons of oil with garlic for two minutes over medium heat. Add fish, stirring carefully until browned.

Upma is a state of mind. The refrain is simple: Carb of choice, toasted in ghee-bloomed spices, then cooked with assorted vegetables and curry leaves and topped with tomato ketchup. In South India the carb of choice is typically toasted semolina, thickened into a creamy, savory porridge. But it can also be made with bread. Bread upma can be made in two contrasting ways. This version captures the best of both;In a wok set over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and heat until shimmering. Add the cubed bread and raw cashews to the pan and toast in oil until crunchy and golden brown, shaking the pan frequently and tossing the bread so it doesn't burn. This will take 5 to 6 minutes.

Cook together for about a minute more. Add the peas and cook for another minute. Carefully drizzle the yogurt over the upma and stir to combine so the bread and vegetables are completely coated. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, stirring only occasionally, so the upma browns and crisps up some more, helped along with the lactose sugar in the yogurt.|Once the upma has crisped up to your desired texture, divide among bowls and serve with chopped cilantro and a fried egg, if you like (I like).;10;20
